# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

This project is to help the HR analyst transition from VBA to SQL to better organize company personnel data, analyze and anticipate hiring needs.  As VBA is not as stable a program as other database methods, SQL will also have the added benefit of parsing out data for the company's needs in a quicker and cleaner process as well as the ability to link up their current databases through data modeling and mapping.

## Overview: 

The client's immediate needs are future-proofing the company by determining how many people will be retiring and, of those employees, who is eligible for a retirement package.  This will be a starting point on how many employees need to be replaced to avoid the effects of staff shortages.  As this is an era when most baby boomers are retiring, the "silver tsunami" is on a much larger scale than normal staff turnover.  Furthermore, two departments want to start a mentorship program with experienced staff that still have an additional year or more before retiring in order to better train and support the onboarding process for new hires.

## Results: 

* Though the company is large, 72,458 eligible employees is 30% of Pewlett-Hackard 's workforce.  This will create a huge vacuum unless the hiring process starts immediately.

* Hiring will need to have staggered start dates as certain positions such as Senior Engineers will see just under 26,000 employees retire with only 169 people eligible for the mentorship program.  Hiring too many people in one department and position level at once will leave trainers besieged and trainees poorly trained.

* Senior positions are also showing to be the highest category of retirees.  While hiring is vital, it would be prudent to also look at current employees who show potential for promotion.  While just under 25,000 Senior Staff are set to retire, only 7,636 Staff will.  With a remaining department of 17,890 employees, some could be promoted to Senior Staff which would allow for less restrictive hiring requirements to fill the lower-level positions.  A similar situation is true for the Senior and Assistant Engineer positions, though to a lesser degree.

* The most concerning position to be filled is that of Manager.  The company currently only shows to have nine with two set to retire.  As there are no managers who qualify for the mentorship program, it's imperative that the two management positions are filled with time for the two Management staff to train their own replacements.

## Summary:

As detailed above, Pewlett-Hackard is going to see a substantial change in employment numbers over the next twelve months and need to start preparing immediately as there are not enough current employees eligible for the mentorship program and alternatives will need to be fleshed out, as explained in the Results.  And as veteran staff transition out, there will inevitably be a shift in staff mentality, expectations and office environment with the incoming new generation.  This can be jarring for those who were brought in under the old system and see through the company's evolving corporate culture.  Beyond hiring on replacements for the retirees, HR and the Board should start preparing for other logistical issues that may arise.  This includes the possibility that starting salaries will be high in order to make the positions more desirable in a tough market for recruitment.  That decision could lead to resentment from veteran employees or a widespread demand for pay raises.  

There is also a difference in approach to how work is accomplished when such a large workforce is onboarded.  It could be beneficial to hire on a consultant to work through current processes, confer with various levels of staff, and determine if there is a more efficient way of achieving the same results.  If things can be streamlined, then there is the further benefit of cutting the number of positions needing to be filled as more can be accomplished by fewer staff.  It provides both new and seasoned employees the opportunity to share their viewpoints and knowledge while both encouraging teamwork and making staff feel valued by asking their opinion.  This approach would also have the added benefit of taking some of the work off of the management's shoulders.

A final suggestion is to use this as an opportunity for restructuring.  This is a stark picture of just how many people hold each title and the potential imbalance in the company network.  Take the opportunity to have exit interviews with the retirees and take their opinions and suggestions under serious consideration.  As stagnation leads to decay, all companies have something to improve upon and this could be the perfect opportunity to address and assess how to best move forward.
